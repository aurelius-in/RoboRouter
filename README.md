# RoboRouter
RoboRouter is an on-prem, multi-agent AI system that turns raw 3D point clouds into explainable maps and safe routes. It handles registration, segmentation, change detection, and navigation with full audit trailsâ€”bridging perception and autonomy for robots in construction, utilities, and manufacturing.
